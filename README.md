## Home ##

*This page gives a summary of the individual, Jack Angus, as well as several key notes of professional development.*

##  Portfolio ##

*Contains several art pieces for the viewer to observe.*

` - Hovering over each piece highlights it.`

` - Ability to click on paintings has been intentionally left null.`

## Networks ##
*Contains several Network topologies tested and implemented by Jack Angus.*

` - Hovering over each design highlights it.`

` - Each topology may be clicked on and viewed in an enlarged format`

## Jokes ##
*Utilizes AJAX and a Dad-Joke API to provide randomly generated Dad Jokes with each click of a designated button.*

` - Has different functions dependent on mobile or PC media query`

` - While in small resolution (gray background),  page simply returns randomized Dad Jokes when button is pressed`

` - While on large resolutions, button will seemingly run away from user, changing to a randomly generated color with each hop (Though it can be caught!)`

#### Footer ####
*Provides direct links to Jack Angus' Email, Github profile, and LinkedIn profile.*

` - Click each for more information! `
